                    We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days
                    after receiving your item to request a return or exchange.
                    Packages must be received or postmarked within a 30-day
                    window of receipt. The original shipping fee is
                    non-refundable except in case of a shipping error or
                    manufacturing defect. To be eligible for a return or
                    exchange, your item must be in the same condition that you
                    received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its
                    original packaging. A receipt or proof of purchase is also
                    required.

                    To start a return, you can contact us at
                    hello@odinleathergoods.com for a return authorization.
                    Include your original order number and reason for the
                    return. If your return is accepted, well send you
                    instructions on how and where to send your package. Items
                    sent back to us without first requesting a return
                    authorization may not be accepted. Please also note that the
                    return address may be different from the senders address on
                    your original package. Returns should ONLY be sent to the
                    address provided in the return authorization. Returns that
                    do not follow this process may result in longer than normal
                    processing time or a decline.

                    Please inspect your order upon receipt and contact us
                    immediately if the item is defective or damaged or if you
                    received the wrong item so we can evaluate the issue and
                    correct any errors. A return label will be provided.

                <p>
                    We will notify you once weve received and inspected your
                    return and let you know if the refund was approved or not.
                    If approved, youll be automatically refunded on your
                    original payment method. Refunds can only be processed
                    within a 30-day window of the original purchase. Please
                    remember it may take several business days for the refund to
                    be reflected on your credit card or banking statement.
