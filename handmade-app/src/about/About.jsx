                    Lion Leather Craft started off in 2017 on the corner of
                    Bianca and Adrian dining room table. Back then it was just
                    an experiment to see if Bianca could make a simple laptop
                    sleeve. Instead of making just one, he made six or seven -
                    each iteration got better and better. Soon others were
                    asking Odin for other items - custom wallets, belts, and
                    more.

                    We often say "this was a curiosity that turned into a hobby,
                    morphed into a business and developed into a brand."

                    Though our operation is still small and lean, we've been
                    able to continuously produce large volumes of our own
                    branded line of leather goods, as well as manufacture
                    white-labeled and co-branded goods for a growing list of
                    clients and customers. We're definitely on the move. Our
                    product philosophy is to keep things simple.{" "}

                    Our designs allude to a classic style and focus on
                    functionality. We want our customers to feel confident that
                    LLC's belts, wallets, and bags are durable enough to travel
                    the world with them, all while still being perfect for
                    everyday use.
